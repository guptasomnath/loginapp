--- Sign Up Api --- 

    EndPoint :- "/signup",
    Method : POST,
    Body Params : username, gmail, password,

    Response If Failed:-  
     {
        
      isSuccess: false,
      message: "Failed Message" 

     }

     Response If Success:- 
    { 
        isSuccess: true,
        message: 'Otp Sended Successfully',
        username : 'your sended username',
        gmail : 'your sended gmail',
        password : 'your sended password'

    }

    Explain:- If a user is new, the server will automatically send a 
              one-time password (OTP) to the user's Gmail when they click on the 
              signup button. Once the response arrives, you can redirect the user 
              to the OTP submission page. When the user clicks on the "Verify OTP" 
              button, you can call the verifyotp API, which will be explained in 
              the next section.


--- Verify OTP Api --- 

    EndPoint :- "/verifyotp",
    Method : POST,
    Body Params : username, gmail, password, otp, vtype = "createaccount"

    Response If Failed : - 
     { 

        isSuccess: false,
        message: "Failed Message" 

     }

     Response If Success:- 

     {
        isSuccess: true,
        message: "Your account is created"

     }

     Explain :- When the user clicks on the "Verify OTP" button, you need 
                to send the necessary information in the body parameters. 
                After the verification is completed, the account will be 
                created.


--- Login OTP Api ---   

    EndPoint :- "/login",
    Method : POST,
    Body Params : gmail, password

    Response If Failed : - 
     { 

        isSuccess: false,
        message: "Failed Message" 

     }

    Response If Success:- 

     {
        isSuccess: true,
        message: `Successfully Login`,
        accessid: rendomAccessId,

     }

--- Forgot Password Api ---   

    EndPoint :- "/verifyotp",
    Method : POST,
    Body Params : gmail, otp, newpassword, vtype = "forgotpassword"

    Response If Failed : - 
     { 

        isSuccess: false,
        message: "Failed Message" 

     }

    Response If Success:- 

     {

        isSuccess: true,
        message: "Password Is Chnaged"

     }

    Explain :- Since the user wants to change their password, we first 
               need to verify their Gmail. Once the user's Gmail is 
               verified, they can proceed to change the password. When 
               you call this API, make sure to include the necessary 
               information in the body parameters. Additionally, it's 
               important to create a logic that can send both the OTP 
               and the new password together when calling this API.
